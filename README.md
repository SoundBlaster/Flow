# Flow
Agentic Workflow

> **Flow** is a text prompt-based agentic workflow for the open source contribution.

## Ideology

Method is the linear _flow_, the step-by-step execution of commands.

Each command is just a prompt.

**Flow** mimiks to a real process in any software company.

## Structure

**Flow** contains basic commands, `Markdown` files:

1. SELECT
2. BRANCH
3. PLAN
4. EXECUTE
5. ARCHIVE
6. REVIEW
7. FOLLOW-UP
8. ARCHIVE-REVIEW
9. PR
10. CI-REVIEW

This chain of commands is grouped in the FLOW workflow-command. This command is a start point of journey for each task.

## Source of Truth

The file `Workflow.md` is the only one **Source of Truth** for the project tasks. 

## Current State

Files for the current task are temproraly placed in the `INPROGRESS` folder.
In this folder the `next.md` file is logging currently selected and executed task and also contains the list of potential next tasks and previously done.

## Skills

This workflow is improved by agent skills. These skills just wrap prompts in shortcuts for CLI agents. These skills are optional.
