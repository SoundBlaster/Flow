# SPECS — Flow Distribution Specs

This folder contains the versioned specification bundle that `install.sh` copies into target repositories.

## Installed Files in a Target Repo

When you run `install.sh`, Flow copies `SPECS/COMMANDS/` and creates user-owned workflow files from `templates/` when missing:

- `SPECS/Workplan.md`
- `SPECS/ARCHIVE/INDEX.md`
- `SPECS/INPROGRESS/next.md`
- `.flow/` (for `.flow/params.yaml`, created by SETUP)

## Configuration Model

Project configuration lives in `.flow/params.yaml` (outside `SPECS/`). This is the single configuration file consumed by commands such as SETUP, EXECUTE, and REVIEW.

Commands reference it as `[Params](.flow/params.yaml)`.

## Maintainer Notes

- Keep `SPECS/VERSION` aligned with `**Version:**` headers in command docs.
- Run `make test` before submitting changes.
- Keep command docs and install behavior aligned with `README.md` and `AGENTS.md`.
