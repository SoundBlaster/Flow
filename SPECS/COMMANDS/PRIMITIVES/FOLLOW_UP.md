# FOLLOW_UP — Create Subtasks from Review Findings

**Version:** 1.1.0

## Overview

After completing a review, extract actionable issues and add them as new tasks to the workplan. This ensures findings are tracked and addressed in future iterations.

## Inputs

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `REVIEW_FILE` | Review report filename (e.g., `REVIEW_api_refactor.md`) |
| `PARENT_TASK_ID` | Original task ID that was reviewed (e.g., `P2-T1`) |

## Steps

### 1. Extract Actionable Issues

Read the review report and identify items that require follow-up work:
- Bug fixes
- Missing functionality
- Performance improvements
- Documentation gaps
- Test coverage needs

### 2. Determine Task IDs

For each new task, assign an appropriate ID following the workplan convention:
- Use the same phase prefix as parent (e.g., `P2-T5` follows `P2-T4`)
- Or create a new category if the issue spans multiple areas

### 3. Add Tasks to Workplan

Update `SPECS/Workplan.md` with new task entries following the existing format:

```markdown
#### P2-T5: New Task Description
- **Description:** Brief description
- **Priority:** P1
- **Dependencies:** P2-T1
- **Parallelizable:** yes/no
- **Acceptance Criteria:** What needs to be true
```

### 4. Archive Review Report

```bash
# Move review report to task archive folder
git mv "SPECS/INPROGRESS/${REVIEW_FILE}" \
       "SPECS/ARCHIVE/${PARENT_TASK_ID}_${TASK_NAME}/"

# Or to _Historical if task folder doesn't exist:
git mv "SPECS/INPROGRESS/${REVIEW_FILE}" \
       "SPECS/ARCHIVE/_Historical/"
```

## Postconditions

- New tasks added to `SPECS/Workplan.md`
- Review report moved to parent task's archive folder or _Historical
- `SPECS/INPROGRESS/` contains no review files for completed tasks

## Skip Conditions

Skip this step if:
- Review found no actionable issues
- All issues were minor and fixed during review
- Issues are duplicates of existing tasks
